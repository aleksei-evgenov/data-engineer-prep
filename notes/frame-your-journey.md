# Why do I want this job?
This choice is a result of several aligned factors. One key reason is that the role of a data engineer perfectly fits the combination of my strengths and interests. I initially explored Data Science and Machine Learning in depth and participated in several Kaggle competitions. During that period, I became very familiar with early-stage data preprocessing using tools like pandas, and I gained hands-on experience with common data transformations similar to SQL operations.

Since the end of 2023, I’ve been working at a company in Munich in a role focused entirely on data pipelines, data transformations, and data storage. I completed three introductory AWS Cloud Services courses and later developed pipelines using AWS technologies. In a subsequent project, I was responsible for designing a data pipeline for a complex system built with Apache NiFi, Elasticsearch, and MinIO.

To summarize: I understand what Data Scientists and ML Engineers need because I’ve been on that side — and now I build exactly what they rely on. This is where I feel confident and effective.

# What kind of projects excite me most in data?
I'm most excited by projects that involve the end-to-end lifecycle of data — especially building data pipelines, performing data transformations, and designing data storage solutions. The combination of these three areas is especially fascinating to me.

Such projects are full of challenges I love to solve:

Choosing the right types of databases

Deciding on replication strategies

Estimating data volume and selecting scalable technologies

Designing for real-time vs batch processing based on business requirements

These questions never have one-size-fits-all answers, and each case pushes me to think critically and apply both engineering and analytical thinking — which is exactly what keeps me motivated.
